# 💎 W7 - DIAMONDS PROJECT 💎

## INTRODUCTION 🔥

This is a project done in the 7th week of my Data Analytics Bootcamp in IRONHACK and consists of analysing and cleaning 2 Diamond datasets (Downloaded from Kaggle.com) to determine and predict the price of diamonds given some variables of the different characteristics they have. To do so, we will use some Machine Learning statistical models which will help our model to be as sharp as possible.


### DATASETS 💾:
- TRAIN 🏋️: (Including all variables and price)
    1. Ordered and cleaned.
    2. Trained with different statistical models.
    3. Tested them in the following dataframe.

- TEST 🧪: (Including all variables but price)
    1. Ordered and cleaned.
    2. Tested with the trained models.


## PURPOSE 🎯
The main purpose of this project is to train different models of Machine Learning we have learned during the past week, to try and predict the price of diamonds with given variables, taking into account the MSE to check in which model is lower.


## PROCESS & METHOD 🛠️

1. DATA 💾: In the data folder, we store our datasets (downloaded from Kaggle.com) which will be hided with a .gitignore., our clean datasets and the predictions from our models.

2. NOTEBOOKS 📓: 
    
    a. Dataframe 📊: Cleaning and exploration of the datasets.

    b. Training 🏋️: Different trainings with Machine Learning on the dataset_
        1. Train-test-split method 
        2. LinearRegression 
        3. DecisionTreeRegressor 
        4. KNeighborsRegressor 
        5. GradientBoostingRegressor 
        6. RandomForestRegressor 

    c. Modelling 💅: Trained models which will determine the predictions on prices of the diamonds.
